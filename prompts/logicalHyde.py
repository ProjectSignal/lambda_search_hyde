# DECISION FRAMEWORK

## When to use each query type:

### dbBasedQuery (Structured Data Fields)
USE FOR:
- Education: dates, degrees, schools, field of study
- Certifications: specific certifications (AWS, PMP, etc.)
- Languages: spoken languages
- Graduation timing: "graduated X years ago", "graduating next year"
- Student status: "still in college", "current students"

DO NOT USE FOR:
- Job titles or roles (use skillBasedQuery with titleKeywords)
- Work experience descriptions (use skillBasedQuery with regexPatterns)
- Company names (use organisationBasedQuery or sectorBasedQuery)
- Demographic/ethnicity queries (these fields don't exist)

### skillBasedQuery (Skills and Roles)
USE FOR:
- Job titles: "CTO", "Product Manager", "Engineer"
- Technical skills: "Machine Learning", "React", "AWS"
- Professional capabilities: "Design", "Marketing", "Sales"

MATCHING STRATEGY:
1. For EXACT titles (C-level, specific positions):
   - Use titleKeywords: ["ceo", "chief executive officer", "founder"]
   
2. For FLEXIBLE role matching (technical roles, variations):
   - Use regexPatterns with title fields
   - CRITICAL: ALWAYS include ["workExperience.title", "linkedinHeadline"] in fields for role matching
   - Generate patterns that match role variations
   
3. For SKILLS (not roles):
   - Use regexPatterns with description fields
   - Include: ["workExperience.description", "bio", "education.description"]

EXAMPLE for flexible role matching:
{
  "name": "Machine Learning",
  "priority": "primary",
  "relatedRoles": ["ML Engineer", "Data Scientist", "AI Engineer"],
  "titleKeywords": ["cto", "chief technology officer"], // Only for exact C-level matches
  "regexPatterns": {
    "keywords": [
      "machine learning", "\\bml\\b", "deep learning",
      "data scien", "engineer", "scientist", "researcher"
    ],
    "fields": [
      "workExperience.title",      // ALWAYS include for role matching
      "linkedinHeadline",           // ALWAYS include for current roles
      "workExperience.description", // For skill context
      "bio"                         // For self-description
    ]
  }
}

CRITICAL: For any role/title matching, ALWAYS include "workExperience.title" and "linkedinHeadline" in fields!

### organisationBasedQuery (Specific Companies)
USE FOR:
- Named companies: "Google", "Tesla", "SpaceX"
- Company groups: "FAANG" (expand to individual companies)

DO NOT USE FOR:
- Company types: "startups", "enterprises" (use sectorBasedQuery)
- Industries: "fintech companies", "healthcare firms" (use sectorBasedQuery)
- Educational institutions: "MIT", "Stanford" (use dbBasedQuery)

### sectorBasedQuery (Industries and Company Types)
USE FOR:
- Industries: "fintech", "healthcare", "e-commerce"
- Company stages: "startup", "series A", "enterprise"
- Combinations: "fintech startup" (create TWO sectors with AND)

INCLUDE companyStage WHEN:
- Query mentions size/stage: "seed", "series A", "unicorn"
- Map to employee ranges:
  - Seed: 1-20
  - Series A: 20-100
  - Series B: 100-500
  - Startup: 1-100
  - Enterprise: 1000+

### locationBasedQuery (Geographic Locations)
USE FOR:
- Cities: "San Francisco", "Bangalore"
- Regions: "Bay Area" (expand to cities)
- States: Only when explicitly mentioned

EXPAND:
- "Bay Area" → ["San Francisco", "Oakland", "San Jose", "Palo Alto"]
- "Silicon Valley" → ["San Francisco", "Palo Alto", "Mountain View", "Cupertino"]
- "blr"/"Bangalore" → ["Bangalore", "Bengaluru"]

## Operator Selection Rules:

### AND Operator:
- Different skill domains required together
- Multiple criteria that must ALL be met
- Explicit "and" or "both" in query
- Cross-sector requirements ("both fintech and healthcare")

### OR Operator (Default):
- Listed alternatives without explicit "and"
- Similar or related items
- Location expansions
- Company groups (FAANG companies)

## Temporal Detection:

### CURRENT ("current"):
- "currently working", "working at", "current", "present"
- Present tense without past indicators

### PAST ("past"):
- "previously", "former", "ex-", "used to"
- Explicit past tense with temporal markers

### ANY ("any" - Default):
- "have been", "have worked" (accumulated experience)
- No temporal context
- General experience queries

IMPORTANT: Apply temporal at INDIVIDUAL item level (each org/sector can have different temporal)

## Sector + Organization Merge Logic

When BOTH sectorBasedQuery=1 AND organisationBasedQuery=1:

The system automatically determines AND/OR logic based on temporal contexts:

### Default: OR Logic (Union)
Used when ANY of these conditions are true:
- All temporal values are the same (e.g., all "any")
- Any temporal value contains "any"
- Query explicitly uses "or" between options

Examples:
- "people from Google or startups" → Both temporal="any" → OR
- "AI researchers from OpenAI, Anthropic, or AI companies" → All temporal="any" → OR

### Exception: AND Logic (Intersection)
Used ONLY when ALL conditions are met:
- Temporal values are DIFFERENT
- NEITHER temporal is "any"
- Indicates sequential career path

Examples:
- "ex-Google people currently in startups" → org temporal="past", sector temporal="current" → AND
- "former consultants now in product roles at fintech" → different temporals → AND

IMPORTANT: You don't specify AND/OR between sectors and organizations - only set temporal values correctly!

# CRITICAL RULES

1. **Role Matching**: ALWAYS use skillBasedQuery with titleKeywords for exact titles, regexPatterns for flexible matching
2. **Temporal Context**: "have been" = temporal:"any" (accumulated experience, not past)
3. **Sector Combinations**: "X startup" = TWO sectors (X industry + Startup stage)
4. **Related Roles**: Must be SIMPLE STRING ARRAY ["Role1", "Role2"], NOT objects
5. **Priority System**: Limit skills - primary (direct), secondary (related), tertiary (rarely)
6. **Education Queries**: Schools and degrees go in dbBasedQuery, not organisationBasedQuery
7. **Sector+Org Logic**: When both present, system uses temporal contexts to determine AND/OR (don't specify operator)
8. **RegexPatterns Fields**: ALWAYS include ["workExperience.title", "linkedinHeadline"] for role matching
